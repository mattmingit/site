![first post](../img/blog/MemojiFirstPost.jpg)

Welcome to my website!
My website is finally online. This is brief a introduction to me and the website itself.
I'm Matteo, a 24 years old guy who's passionate about finance and computer science. You'll find more information [here](/about).
I made this website to share my works and to get in touch with people. The website is composed by four pages.

The **_home page_** is the most important one, it consists in a sort of database of projects projects I worked on or I have contributed to.
The **_about page_** is the place where you can get to know me as person, what educational background I have, and my work experience, if any.
The **_blog page_** is the place where i will share thoughts, projects, and other things I feel like writing about.
The **_fun page_** is where I will post about short fun projects and code snippets to implement and create stuff.

I designed and coded the website by myself using **typescript**, **tailwindcss** and **NextJs** framework.
Hope you'll enjoy it and if you have questions or find bugs feel free to reach out!
