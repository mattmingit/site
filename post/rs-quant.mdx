Quantitative finance has transformed modern financial markets, leveraging mathematical models, statistical techniques, and computational power to drive data-driven investment decisions.
From [high-frequency](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading) trading to [risk management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_risk_management), financial professionals increasingly rely on sophisticated algorithms to analyze vast datasets and execute trades efficiently.

Building robust and efficient quantiative finance tools requires a programming language that is both high-performance and safe. Usually, Python and C++ have been the dominant choice, with Python offering ease of use and extensive libraries, while C++ delivers raw speed. However, **Rust** has emerged as a compelling alterative, providing memory safety, concurrency, and performance without compromising reliability.

This blog post introduces to **_rs-quant_**, a Rust-based library i'm designing to facilitate quantitative finance modeling and financial data analysis. The goal is to create a flexible, high-performance framework that empowers developers and researchers to build and test their own financial models. We'll explore why Rust is well-suited for this sector, the structure of _rs-quant_, its current development state, and the roadmap for future enhancements.

<MdxH3>Why Rust for quantitative finance?</MdxH3>

When it comes to quant finance, performance, reliability, and safety are critical. Financial applications often require complex computations on large datasets, real-time decision-making, and multi-threaded processing for speed. Traditionally, [Python](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) and [C++](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) have been the go-to choice for quant development, Python fo its rich rich ecosystem of finance and data analysis libraries and C++ for its speed and low-level control. However, [Rust](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rust_(programming_language)) offers a compelling alternative that combines the best of both worlds: high performance, memory safety, and modern concurrency features.

<ListItem>1. Performance without compromise</ListItem>
Rust's low-level control and zero-cost abstractions enable highly optimized code execution, making it ideal for numerical and financial computing. Unlike Python, which relies on intrepreter overhead and external libraries for speed, Rust compiles to machine code, eliminating performance bottlenecks. In quant finance, where milliseconds can impact trade execution, Rust's efficiency can provide a competitive edge.

<ListItem>2. Memory safety and reliability</ListItem>
Financial software must be highly reliable, errors like memory leaks, null pointer dereferences, or race conditions can lead to failures. Rust’s ownership model ensures memory safety at compile time, preventing common bugs that plague C++ applications. This reduces the risk of hidden vulnerabilities in financial models and trading systems.  

<ListItem>3. Concurrency for parallel computation</ListItem>
Rust’s built-in concurrency model, powered by fearless concurrency and thread safety, makes it well-suited for parallelized computations. Large-scale financial simulations often require multi-threading for speed. Rust’s approach prevents data races while allowing efficient use of multiple CPU cores, making it a strong contender for building scalable financial applications.

<ListItem>4. Interoperbility with existing quant systems</ListItem>
While Rust is still growing in the finance industry, it offers interoperability with Python (via PyO3) and C/C++ (via FFI). This allows Rust-based quant libraries to integrate with existing financial ecosystems, leveraging Rust’s performance while maintaining compatibility with widely used finance tools.

<ListItem>5. Long-term maintainability</ListItem>
Rust’s strict compiler guarantees safer, more maintainable code, reducing technical debt over time. This is particularly important for financial institutions and hedge funds that maintain complex, long-lived codebases. By preventing subtle runtime bugs, Rust helps ensure that critical financial applications remain stable and robust.

<MdxH3>Goals of rs-quant</MdxH3>

Rs-quant stems from my personal need. It aims to provide a high-performance, reliable, and extensible framework for quantitative finance. It aims to support complex financial modeling and to handle large amount of data.
Below are the key goals of the project:

<ListItem>1. Safe, reliable and high-performance</ListItem>
Financial models involves intensive numerical computations, from pricing derivatives to optimizing portfolios. _rs-quant_ aims to leverage Rust's speed and memory efficiency to execute complex financial algorithms with minimal overhead. It also takes advantage of Rust's strict memory safety, preventing segmentation faults, data races, and undefined behavior. This ensures that models and algorithms developed in the library are robust and reliable.

<ListItem>2. Backtesting and simulation</ListItem>
Backtesting is a crucial step in developing strategies. _rs-quant_ aims to provide a high-speed, accurate backtesting engine that can simulate trading strategies on historical data while accounting for market conditions as transaction costs. This will help to evaluate and refine my models.

<ListItem>3. Data processing</ListItem>
_rs-quant_ will try to leverage Rust's high performance and concurrency model to process large datasets efficiently. 

<MdxH3>Project structure</MdxH3>

The architecture of _rs-quant_ is designed to provide structured and efficient foundation for quantitative finance applications. The library is organized into multiple crates and modules, each responsible for a specific aspect of financial computation. Below is an overview of its structure.

Currently, the project is divided into the following main crates:

<ListItem>1. `commons` (utilities and parsing tools)</ListItem> 
General utility functions and parsers. The commons module provides essential and parsing tools to support other components of _rs-quant_. It includes data handling utilities, financial data parsers, and general helper functions. These features ensure standardized date and time processing while enabling efficient data parsing from external sources.

<ListItem>2. `data` (market data retrieval and handling)</ListItem> 
Data retrieval and handling from sources like Yahoo! finance and World Bank Group. The data module is responsible for fetching and managing financial data from various providers. It includes mechanisms for error handling, retrieving macroeconomic data from Wrold Bank API, and fetching market data from Yahoo! Finance API. This module provides a structured interface for accessing financial data while ensuring robustness when interacting with external API.

<ListItem>3. `database` (data storage and queries)</ListItem> 
Database connections and query management. The database module manages database connections and efficiently handles financial data queries. It establishes secure connections to databases and provides structured queries for retrieving stored portfolio and market data. This module ensures efficient data storage and access.

<ListItem>4. `portfolio` (portfolio and position management)</ListItem> 
Portfolio modeling and position tracking. The portfolio module is designed to handle portfolio tracking, position management, and performance evaluation. It defines portfolio structures, tracks individual asset positions, and facilitates portfolio-based analysis. By integrating with other modules, it provides a comprehensive approach to managing financial portfolios.

<ListItem>5. `quantitative` (financial computation and analytics)</ListItem> 
Core quantitative finance computations, including risk metrics and statistics. The quantitative module serves as the core computational engine for rs-quant, providing essential mathematical and statistical tools for financial modeling. It includes error management for quantitative methods, calculations for derivative risk sensitivities (greeks), matrix operations, asset and portfolio return computations, numerical root-finding algorithms, and key financial statistics such as alpha and beta. This module enables advanced risk analysis, portfolio optimization, and statistical modeling, making it a fundamental component of the library. 

<MdxH3>Current development status</MdxH3>

The development of _rs-quant_ is progressing steadily, with foundational components already implemented and ongoing work on key data handling and statistical analysis features. Below is an overview of the current state of the project.

<ListItem>1. Implemented features</ListItem>
Efficient data storage and retrieval have been implemented using `Vec` and `Array1`, ensuring a structured approach to handling financial time series.

Integration with Yahoo! Finance for historical market data has been implemented, allowing access to asset prices. Additionally, data retrieval from the World Bank is currently in progress, expanding the availability of macroeconomics indicators. 

Core statistical methods have been implemented, including central tendency measures (mean, median) and dispersion metrics (variance, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis). These form the foundation for quantitative analysis and financial modeling. 

The library currently supports MySQL database connectivity, enabling to store and retrieve portfolio data efficiently. 

<ListItem>2. Ongoing development</ListItem>
Work is underway to complete the integration of historical data from the World Bank. Future efforts will focus on adding more providers.

While core descriptive statistics are in place, further development is needed to implement advanced time series analysis, volatility modeling (GARCH, Heston), and forecasting techniques like ARIMA and Kalman filters. So many more have to be implemented.

Initial groundwork has been laid, but more comprehensive portfolio tracking, risk metrics, and optimization techniques (Markowitz Mean-Variance, Black-Litterman) are yet to be implemented.

<ListItem>3. Challenge faced</ListItem>
While historical data integration has been successful (despite the difficulty of finding data providers without excessive api limitations given the high prices of services provided by api providers), real-time data access remains a challenge due to API limitations and licensing restrictions. Optimizing data ingestion and caching mechanisms will be crucial for future scalability.  

Handling large datasets efficiently requires optimized numerical operations. While `ndarray` is planned for use in matrix operations, further benchmarking will be needed to ensure performance scalability.

I am also considering to implement the use of parquet files to store OHLCV data and an [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) to allow parquet-database and parquet-library interactions.

<MdxH3>Upcoming features</MdxH3>

Future development of _rs-quant_ will focus on expanding its capabilities. A backtesting framework will be implemented with event-driven simulations, order book modeling, and execution slippage handling to improve strategy evaluation. I aim to integrate machine learning and artificial intelligence models, incorporating reinforcement learning, predictive modeling and deep learning techniques to support investment and trading decisions.

Risk analysis will be expanded with Monte Carlo simulations, stress testing, and additional risk management frameworks to provide a more comprehensive toolkit for evaluating financial risk. 

Real-time market data processing will be introduced, allowing the library to handle intraday trading and high-frequency data streams.

Trading strategy implementations will be done to include momentum-based strategies, statistical arbitrage, and market-making techniques, to give a diverse set of tools for strategy development.
