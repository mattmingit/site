This weekend I decided to take a couple of days of rest.
I decided to escape in Tuscany for two days. The first day I've been in Chianciano Terme which is known for its thermal waters.
The next day I've been in Montepulciano, well known for his wine. Here I visited the town and a winery, and tasted some wines and really good foods.

Tuscany never disappoints.❤️
