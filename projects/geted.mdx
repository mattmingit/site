Geted is a note sharing platform for students. It is completely free and it doesn't require any type of users personal data to work. <br/>
Everyone can use and send files without any constraints. <br/>
The project currently offline, but once it'll be online again you can have a look at geted.it or geted.eu.

<MdxH3>Project Overview</MdxH3>

<span className="text-blue">What is Geted?</span>

GetEd is a note sharing platform for students made by a student. <br />
On GetEd you can read, download and use all the content made available on the
platform or upload your notes to help other students.

<span className="text-blue">Why did I make Geted?</span>

As student I&apos;ve always looked for notes and exercises besides mine to learn
the most from what I was studying. <br />
It was a real hunt! <br />
So I decided to make a website where students can find and share notes and help each
other.

<MdxH3>Phase of work</MdxH3>

The work begins with the schematic representation of the project
through which I try to outline the structure of the latter and the
interactions between the components that will be used by the users.<br/>
Doing this way I also outline a sort of hypothetical navigation of
the website by users in order to understand whether the website is
easily usable or too complex.

The functioning and experience deriving from individual components
of the site occur through a less schematic but more detailed process
in which I try to identify with the end user who tries to use the
aforementioned components.

<MdxH3>Conclusions</MdxH3>

The project was really fun. It is my approach to coding and I enjoy working on it.<br/>
I think it can be helpfull for students who are looking for something more to study on.
